      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Electromicrobiology at the University of
        Queensland â€“ IIT Delhi Research Academy. My work examines Shewanella
        oneidensis nanowire formation during extracellular electron transfer and
        the effects of heavy metals in electrochemical environments. This
        research integrates microbiology and electrochemistry to advance
        bioelectrochemical systems for sustainable energy and metal recovery.
